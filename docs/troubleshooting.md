# Troubleshooting

Each entry starts with what you see — the wording is the plugin's own English text — then the cause and what to do. If yours is not here, see [Getting help](#getting-help).

## The model is not downloaded

> The built-in model (SD-Turbo, …) is not downloaded yet. Nothing is downloaded before you click.

**Cause:** the built-in engine needs its model files, and the plugin never fetches them on its own.

**Fix:** click **Download model** in the panel, or use the model row under **Settings → Local Image Generator → Engine**. If the panel says the model is *partly downloaded*, the button reads **Download the missing …** and fetches only what is left.

## Checksum mismatch

> Checksum mismatch for … — the file was discarded. Try the download again.

**Cause:** a downloaded file did not match the checksum pinned in the plugin, so it was thrown away. Usually a broken connection or a mirror that serves a different file.

**Fix:** click the download button again; finished, valid files are kept. If you changed **Download source** under **Advanced**, set it back to the default and try again.

## The built-in engine is unavailable

> WebGPU is not available in this Obsidian — use a server (settings)

> The GPU has no shader-f16 — use a server (settings)

**Cause:** the built-in engine needs WebGPU with 16-bit shaders. Apple Silicon Macs and most current discrete GPUs have it; older or virtualised GPUs do not.

**Fix:** switch **Engine** to **Server (Draw Things / A1111)** or **ComfyUI (your workflow)** under **Settings → Local Image Generator**.

## Not enough memory

> Not enough memory for this model — free up GPU memory or switch to a server backend.

**Cause:** the model does not fit. SDXL-Turbo needs roughly 13 GB at its peak while the session is built; SD-Turbo about 4 GB.

**Fix:** close other GPU-heavy apps, or choose the smaller model (SD-Turbo) under **Model**, or use a server.

## Loading the model takes forever

> Loading the model into the GPU is taking unusually long or got stuck silently. Click Generate to try again.

**Cause:** the plugin stops waiting after five minutes, because the runtime offers no way to cancel a stuck load.

**Fix:** click **Generate** again. If it keeps happening, restart Obsidian and retry.

## Server unreachable

> Server unreachable — is the API enabled?

**Cause:** in server mode nothing answered at the **Server endpoint**. The server app is not running, its API is off, or the address is wrong.

**Fix:** start the server and enable its API (Draw Things: switch on the API server in its settings; AUTOMATIC1111 and Forge: launch with `--api`). Then press **Test connection** in the settings, or **Retry** in the panel. A server that is up shows "Server OK — model: …".

## No ComfyUI at this address

> No ComfyUI at this address (default port 8188, or 8000 in the ComfyUI desktop app) — is it running?

**Cause:** the endpoint is shared between Server and ComfyUI mode. An address left over from Draw Things or AUTOMATIC1111 answers, but not with ComfyUI's API.

**Fix:** enter the address of your ComfyUI server under **ComfyUI endpoint**: `http://127.0.0.1:8188`, or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the ComfyUI desktop app.

## The workflow is not accepted

The **Workflow file** must be a workflow exported from ComfyUI in API format. The plugin names the problem:

| Message | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The file is not valid JSON. | The file is damaged or not a workflow. Export it again. |
| Not a workflow: expected an object of nodes. Export from ComfyUI with 'Save (API format)', not the normal save. | Use **Save (API format)** in ComfyUI. |
| No sampler found — no node takes positive, negative and latent_image together. | The plugin looks for one sampler node; without it there is nothing to fill in. |
| Several samplers found (…). Refiner chains aren't supported — the plugin can't tell which one to fill in. | Reduce the workflow to a single sampler. |
| This sampler has no steps field … | Use a sampler with a `steps` field (for example KSampler). |
| The latent node carries no width/height … Use EmptyLatentImage as the sampler's latent_image. | Feed the sampler from an **EmptyLatentImage** node. |

"Workflow file not found: …" means the file was moved or deleted; pick it again with **Choose…**.

## Nothing happens when I press Generate

> Not possible while an image is being generated — wait for it to finish.

**Cause:** only one image is made at a time — by this panel or by another plugin using the generator (the status line then reads "Another plugin is generating an image…").

**Fix:** wait for the running image to finish.
